            <p class="sectionsubtag smalltext">Pakistan teachers face knowledge gaps regarding human rights due to
                outdated teacher education curriculum. Many Pakistani leaders and teachers hold conservative beliefs
                that education policies need to remain aligned with national Islamic ideology, which does not focus on
                human rights. Global policy makers are aware that teachers promote human rights and ethics and should
                receive a course in their teacher training programs about basic human rights. A study revealed that
                reflective writing and case studies have been the best approach to raising awareness about human rights
                issues in teacher preparation programs in Pakistan.[4</p>

            <p class="sectionsubtag smalltext">The education system in Pakistan[4] is generally divided into six levels:
                preschool (for the age from 3 to 5 years), primary (grades one through five), middle (grades six through
                eight), high (grades nine and ten, leading to the Secondary School Certificate or SSC), intermediate
                (grades eleven and twelve, leading to a Higher Secondary School Certificate or HSSC), and university
                programs leading to undergraduate and graduate degrees.[5] The Higher Education Commission established
                in 2002 is responsible for all universities and degree awarding institutes.[6] It was established in
                2002 with Prof. Atta-ur-Rahman FRS as its Founding Chairman.[7]</p>

            <p class="sectionsubtag smalltext">Teacher education is reform is crucial in improving education in
                Pakistan. Teacher training programs at universities lack qualified professionals. Almost one-third of
                universities in Balochistan do not have professors in their teacher education departments and there was
                not a PhD in Education at any of the universities in Balochistan. Teachers are the focal point of
                establishing progressive education. Teacher preparation programs need funding and consistency to produce
                quality, effective teachers. Teacher reform needs to continue by establishing resources and investments.
                Time needs to be invested in updating curriculum and teacher education facilities. Investments must be
                made in updating building infrastructures, libraries, IT departments, and laboratories.[</p>
